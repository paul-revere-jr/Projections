Future UK Muslim, Non-Muslim and Jihadist Population Projections


Summary

The Python code apop.py computes future UK Muslim and non-Muslim population 
projections under 3 different sets of assumptions, and a possible future UK
Jihadist population under 1 set of assumptions, producing Fig1.jpg.

The source code is both annotated and fully referenced.


Data

The code requires 6 data files be present in order to run.

Five of these are from the UK 2011 census and can therefore be made available
here under the terms of the UK's Open Government License.   Download the file 
ukdata.zip and unzip and untar it in the same directory as apop.py.

The last data file is UN Copyright and must therefore be downloaded directly
from the un.org website.  Download Table A.5 from 
http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/dataset/fertility/wfr2012/MainFrame.html 
and save it as "TABLE A.5. Period fertility indicators.xlsx" without the 
quotes in the same directory as apop.py.
